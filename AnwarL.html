	<h2 style="font-family: Advent Pro; font-size: 30px; color: khaki">Where I'm Coming From</h2>
	<br>
	<p align="center" style="color: white">
		Ever since I was 10, I would always be lost in thought, trying to find my purpose. I would always hear people say 
		<i style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-size: 20px;">
		"Everyone is meant to contribute to the world and solve a problem."
	</i>
	 Well, I didn't know what that problem was and I wanted, so badly to find out. 
	 <br>
	 I ventured through music, art, architecture and filmatography but still couldn't find my true purpose or a sense of fulfillment.

	</p>
	<p align="center" style="color: white">I discovered minimalism at the age of 15 and later embraced it at the age of 17. It was my first big step in my journey to a fulfilled, happy life.
		<br>
		<i style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-size: 20px;">"Happiness is not about having more. It is found in the ability to live comfortably with less."</i>
		<br>
	Minimalism really cleared a path for me. It made me see what I was doing and to declutter my headspace. I felt great, but my journey had just started.</p>
	<p align="center;" style="color: white">I later ventured into self-improvement videos, books, podcasts and anything else you can think of. My reading speed went from reading a 300 page book in 6 months to being able to read a total of 1,500 pages a day. I flew threw all kinds of books, ranging from 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: palegoldenrod">'Rich Dad, Poor Dad'</a> 
		to 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439199191/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/358-3911557-5016137?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1439199191&pd_rd_r=3b0cfe6d-ee7d-4ec3-9fbf-c97b87ea0289&pd_rd_w=9tquS&pd_rd_wg=G4eyY&pf_rd_p=4b55d259-ebf0-4306-905a-7762d1b93740&pf_rd_r=BBXXFE3XV3K7NHAVBGC0&psc=1&refRID=BBXXFE3XV3K7NHAVBGC0" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: palegoldenrod">'How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></p>
	<p align="center" style="color: white">My big break came when I began studying Japanese culture and their lifestyle. It all started when I read the book 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Kaizen-Japanese-Method-Transforming-Habits/dp/1529005353" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: palegoldenrod">Kaizen.</a>
		 It gave me an instant desire to learn more about the Japanese nature of living. After, months of daily research and bumping into another book on the topic, 
		 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Ikigai-Japanese-secret-long-happy/dp/178633089X" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: palegoldenrod"> Ikigai, </a>
		 I literally fell in love with the country's culture. I finally found complete peace of mind and learned how to obtain complete calmness and the be able to be present in the moment (whenever some calming Japanese piano music was playing). 
		 <br>
		 The culture was absolutely amazing and I fell in love with Japan's beautiful nature and language. I was always an anime watcher, so I had the prehistoric interest in visiting the place. I now am happy to say that I will get my chance as I'll be hopefully studying and continuing my education there, in coming years.
	</p>
	<p align="center" style="color: white">
		Few months later, I bumped into my next self-improvement boost. The elusive beast known in the wild jungles as Elon Musk. His productivity methods, ideas and work level were enough to make me a fan boy. He became my role model and I did my best to find every single productivity hack he uses and immedietly implied it. 
		<br>
		I now work for around 75 hours a week and also currently executing my 30-year plan in only 4 months. The boost in my personal productivity levels skyrocketed. Of course this was also assisted by the other productivity courses I took from Ali Abdaal, Tohmas Frank, Tony Robbins and other names that circulate the productivity circle.
	</p>
	<p style="color: white;">
		I think it's safe to say that this is a pretty good recap of my self-imrovement journey so far. I currently am still going along my path to ultimate success. Be sure to follow me on Instagram and Twitter to stay updated on how the journey is going.
