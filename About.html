	Where I'm Coming From
</h2>
	
<p align="center" style="color: #424242">
		Ever since I was 10, I would always be lost in thought, trying to find my purpose. I would always hear people say 
		<br><br>
	<i style="color: #808080; font-size: 18px;">
		"Everyone is meant to contribute to the world and solve a problem."
	</i>
	<br><br>
	 Well, I didn't know what that problem was and I wanted so badly to find out.  
	<br>
	 I ventured through music, art, architecture and filmatography but still couldn't find my true purpose or a sense of fulfillment.

</p>

<p align="center" style="color: #424242">I discovered minimalism at the age of 15 and later embraced it at the age of 17. It was my first big step in my journey to a fulfilled, happy life.
		<br><br>
		<i style="color: #808080; font-size: 20px;">
		"Happiness is not about having more, it is found in the ability to live comfortably with less."</i>
		<br><br>
	Minimalism really cleared a path for me and decluttered my headspace. It felt great, however, my journey had just begun.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center;" style="color: #424242">
	I later ventured into self-development videos, books, podcasts and anything else I could find. My reading speed went from reading a 300 page book in 6 months to being able to read a total of 1,500 pages a day. I sailed threw all kinds of books, from 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: black;">
			'Rich Dad, Poor Dad'
		</a> 
		to 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439199191/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/358-3911557-5016137?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1439199191&pd_rd_r=3b0cfe6d-ee7d-4ec3-9fbf-c97b87ea0289&pd_rd_w=9tquS&pd_rd_wg=G4eyY&pf_rd_p=4b55d259-ebf0-4306-905a-7762d1b93740&pf_rd_r=BBXXFE3XV3K7NHAVBGC0&psc=1&refRID=BBXXFE3XV3K7NHAVBGC0" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: black;">

<p align="center" style="color: #424242;">My big break came when I began studying Japanese culture and their lifestyle. It all started when I read the book 
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Kaizen-Japanese-Method-Transforming-Habits/dp/1529005353" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: black">Kaizen.
		</a>
		 It gave me an instant desire to learn more about the Japanese nature of living. 
		 <br>
		 After, months of daily research and bumping into another book on the topic, 
		 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Ikigai-Japanese-secret-long-happy/dp/178633089X" target="_blank" title="Buy The Book" style="color: black;"> Ikigai, 
		 </a>
		 I literally fell in love with the country's culture. 
		 <br>
		 I finally found peace of mind and learned how to obtain complete calmness and the ability to be present in the moment (whenever some calming Japanese piano music was playing). 
		 <br><br>
		 The culture was absolutely amazing and I fell in love with Japan's beautiful nature and language. I was always an anime fan, so I had the prehistoric interest in visiting the place..
</p>
<br>
<p align="center" style="color: #424242">
		Few months later, I bumped into my next self-improvement boost. The elusive beast known in the wild jungles as Elon Musk. His productivity methods, ideas and work level were enough to make me a fan boy. He became my role model and I did my best to find every single productivity hack he uses and immedietly implied it. 
		<br><br>
		I now work for around 75 hours a week and also currently executing my 30-year plan in only 4 months (a concept I learned from Elon Musk). The boost in my personal productivity levels skyrocketed. Of course this was also assisted by the other productivity courses I took from Ali Abdaal, Tohmas Frank, Tony Robbins, Jay Shetty and other names that circulated in the productivity circle.
</p>
<br>
<p style="color: #424242;">
		I think it's safe to say that this is a pretty good recap of my self-imrovement journey so far. I currently am still going along my path to ultimate success. Be sure to follow me on Instagram and Twitter to stay updated on how the journey is going.
